The important of learning DevOps engineering:

1. Maximizes Efficiency with Automation:

According to Robert Stroud, a DevOps authority who has passed away, DevOps is all about "fueling business transformation" by changing people, processes, and cultures.
An effective DevOps transformation involves making structural improvements that build community, and a successful DevOps project requires an effort to improve multiple teams' collaboration, including product development, engineering, security, IT, operations, 
and so on—along with automation—in order to achieve business goals more effectively.

2. Optimizes the Entire Business:

Known as the originator of the DevOps movement, system architect Patrick Debois says that its biggest advantage is its ability to drive business-wide improvements by optimizing the whole system, not just IT silos.

3. Improves Speed and Stability of Software Development and Deployment
